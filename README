The `run.py` script generates the release notes page for Release, Aurora, Beta, and ESR. 

Instructions:

1. Make sure you have the connection information for the postgres database shared by release management.
2. Install the requirements (`pip install -r requirements/compiled.txt`)
3. Run `python run.py -o <output dir> -c [channels,] --{aurora,beta,esr}-suffix <suffix>`

The output dir will contain the generated release notes pages.
